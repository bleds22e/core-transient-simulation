## An example of a parameter file for running multiple simulations
## Parameters indicated as optional are set to default values and can be omitted since these deaults are stored within simulation functions


## Define the landscape: make_landscape()
dimX = 10 									# Number of rows
dimY = 10 									# Number of columns
vgm_dcorr = min(dimX, dimY)/3 					# (optional) Distance at which habitat is uncorrelated
vgm_mod = vgm(psill=1, model='Exp', range=vgm_dcorr) 		# (optional) Variogram model controling spatial autocorrelation of habitat types
habA_prop = 0.5								# (optional) Proportion of landscape that is type 'A'


## Define the species pool: make_species() and make_sad()
S_A = 10									# Number of species specializing on habitat A
S_B = 10									# Number of species specializing on habitat B
S_AB = 0									# (optional) Number of generalist species
dist_b = list(type='uniform', maxN=10)				# (optional) Distribution from which species birth rates are drawn. See make_sad() for options.
m_rates = c(.1, .1, .1)							# Mortality rates in preferred and unpreferred habitat. Optionally a third number for generalist mortality.
r_rates = c(.9, .9, .9)							# Recruitment rates in preferred and unpreferred habitat. Optionally a third number of generalist recruitment.
dist_d = list(mu=1, var=0)						# (optional) List of the mean and variance of the gamma distribution from which species expected dispersal distances are drawn.
dist_v = list(mu=c(0, 0, 0), var=c(0, 0, 0))				# (optional) List of vectors of the means and variances for the gamma distributions from which species expected movement distances are drawn [preferred, unpreferred, (optional) generalist].
dist_gsad = list(type='same')						# (optional) Distribution from which global species abundances are drawn. See make_sad(). Or, a string indicating that abundances should equal species birth rates.


## Define how the simulation is initialized: populate_landscape()
K = 20									# Integer giving the carrying capacity of each cell. Or, a matrix specifying a capacity for each cell.								
prop_full = 1								# (optional) Proportion of the carrying capacity to fill initially.					
init_distribute = 'same'						# (optional) String indicating how individuals should initially be distributed across the landscape: 'same','uniform','designate'. See populate_landscape().
cells_distribute = data.frame(x=5, y=5, n=20)			# (optional) If init_distribute='designated', this is a matrix giving the locations of cells in which to place individuals. An optional third column gives the number of individuals in each cell.


## Define how the simulation should run
nsteps = 20									# Number of timesteps to run the simulation.
d_kernel = list(type='gaussian')					# (optional) Distribution defining the shape of an individual's dispersal kernel.
v_kernel = list(type='gaussian')					# (optional) Distribution defining the shape of an individual's movement kernel.
imm_rate = 0								# (optional) Immigration rate: probability that an empty space is colonized from outside the landscape.
	

## Define how the simulation should be saved
nruns = 3									# Number of independent simulation runs to perform with this set of parameters
save_steps = seq(0, nsteps, 1)					# (optional) Vector of timesteps to save. Including 0 saves the initial metacommunity.
simID = 'test'								# (optional) String identifying this run. Used for saving simulation results.
