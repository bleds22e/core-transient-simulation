# core-transient-simulation

This project is a spatially explicit simulation of metacommunity dynamics that models habitat filtering and dispersal.

## Simulation Description
The simulation occurs on a regular grid of cells (termed the 'landscape') and each cell has discrete habitat type, 'A' or 'B'. Each cell contains a 'community' of individuals, which is fixed at a pre-determined carrying capacity. Communities may contain fewer individuals than the carrying capacity, but not more. The species pool consists of three types of species- generalists, and habitat specialists on habitat type A or B. Generalists produce offspring in both habitat types while specialists only produce offspring in their preferred habitat. After initializing a simulation landscape and species pool, the simulation proceeds through repeated iteration of four processes: birth - dispersal - establishment - death. Once established, individuals vacate their place in the community only through dispersal or death- the simulation does not model competitive displacement.
